1) If on same machine as certificate was requested on, certificate is in store.
   Go into Internet Options and export pvk file.
   
2) If you have new .SPC file (eg from renewal) and existing PFX file, and
   are possibly on a different machine, then follow instructions here:
      https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4682642/joining-godaddy-issued-spc-and-key-files-into-a-complete-pfx-cer-certifica
   to export private key from existing PFX, convert to PVK, and then
   combine with SPC into new PFX. *Except* first command to export private
   key may not work? Similar command here worked:
      https://ca.godaddy.com/help/converting-an-exported-pfx-code-signing-file-to-pvk-and-spc-files-using-windows-6034
   So commands were:
       openssl pkcs12 -in inf.pfx -nocerts -nodes -out outf.pem
       pvk.exe -in CodeSign.pem -topvk -strong -out CodeSign.pvk
	   pvk2pfx.exe -pvk CodeSign.pvk -pi <passphrase> -spc CodeSign.spc -pfx CodeSign.pfx -po <passphrase> -f
   
   ** Find pvk2pfx.exe by searching in C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\bin\
   ** get openssl.exe here: https://mirror.firedaemon.com/index.php?dir=OpenSSL%2F
